# Simulating LFPs as a Superposition of Synaptic Kernels
Work in progress...

---

To do list:

1. Test three different ways to quantify the excitatory-inhibitory balance: (1) duration of the $\Psi$ pattern (time taken to descend to 15% of the maximum amplitude); (2) slope of the aperiodic component through a linear regression between 40 and 85 Hz; (3) slope of the aperiodic component through a double exponent fit between 1 and 300 Hz.
2. Describe the main properties of the $\Psi$ pattern: (1) its ability to recover a single kernel from the signal; (2) the linear combination that is obtained when multiple kernels are present. Here I should also add the definition of FPP and its applications to bioelectric signals (show some signals with and without stochastic interference).
3. Add the posibility to simulate oscilatory activity by making the firing rate a function over time. Compute the $\Psi$ pattern and detrend the oscilatory contamination to recover the 'true' kernel shape. Compute the PSD to observe the periodic peaks in the frequency content of the signal.
